# 0x14-mysql

This repository contains the solutions to the advanced tasks given in the "0x14-mysql" project.

## Tasks

### [Task 0: Install MySQL](./0-install_mysql_configuration/)
In this task, we installed and configured MySQL for our development environment.

### [Task 1: Let us in!](./1-temple/)
Here, we created a MySQL user and granted it permissions to access the `hbtn_0d_0` database.

### [Task 2: If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes](./2-vulnerable_bulletin_board/)
In this task, we performed a SQL injection attack on a vulnerable web application to extract sensitive information.

### [Task 3: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?](./3-safeguarding_sensitive_information/)
Here, we implemented measures to safeguard sensitive information, including encryption and hashing.

### [Task 4: Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL](./4-mysql_configuration_primary/)
In this task, we set up a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL to ensure high availability and load balancing.

### [Task 5: MySQL backup](./5-mysql_backup/)
Here, we implemented a backup and recovery strategy for our MySQL database in the event of data loss.

All these tasks have helped us acquire advanced knowledge of MySQL and its configurations, security, and maintenance.
