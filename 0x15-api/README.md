# 0x15. API

Welcome to the 0x15 API Repository! In this repository, you will embark on a journey to learn how to build and work with APIs.

Beginning with the fundamentals of data gathering from an API endpoint in [0-gather_data_from_an_API](./0-gather_data_from_an_API.py/), you will gradually improve your skills by exporting data to a CSV file in [1-export_to_CSV](./1-export_to_CSV.py/), and then exporting data to a JSON file in [2-export_to_JSON](./2-export_to_JSON.py/).

In the final task [3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries](./3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py/), we will create a script that exports API data to a JSON file in a specific format. Through these tasks, you will learn how to manipulate data structures in Python, handle HTTP requests and responses, and work with CSV and JSON files.

Are you ready to step up to the challenge? Get ready to master the art of APIs

This repository contains four tasks related to building APIs, each task building upon the knowledge gained from the previous tasks:

- [0-gather_data_from_an_API](./0-gather_data_from_an_API.py/): In this task, we use Python to gather data from an API endpoint and display it in a specific format. We learn the basics of using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, and how to handle the response data.

- [1-export_to_CSV](./1-export_to_CSV.py/): In this task, we add functionality to export data from the API to a CSV file. This task demonstrates how to use the `csv` module in Python to write data to a CSV file.

- [2-export_to_JSON](./2-export_to_JSON.py/): In this task, we modify our script to export data to a JSON file. We learn how to use the `json` module in Python to serialize data to JSON format.

- [3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries](./3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py/): Finally, we create a script that exports data from the API to a JSON file in a particular format. This task shows us how to manipulate data structures in Python to create the desired output.

Through these tasks, we gain knowledge and experience in building APIs using Python, including handling HTTP requests and responses, working with CSV and JSON files, and manipulating data structures.
