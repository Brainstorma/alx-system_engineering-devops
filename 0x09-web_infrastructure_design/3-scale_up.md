# Application Server vs Web Server

## Introduction

In this document, we will discuss the differences between application server and web server. We will also talk about the requirements for setting up an infrastructure for web applications using a combination of application and web servers.

## Application Server vs Web Server

### Web Server

A web server is a program that serves static content (HTML, images, etc.) to clients, usually over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. It handles requests from clients and responds with the requested content. Examples of web servers include Apache HTTP server, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.

### Application Server

An application server is a program that provides dynamic content (generated by programs) to clients. It typically provides services such as connection pooling, distributed transactions, and security. The application server sits between the client and the database and processes requests from the client before returning a response. Examples of application servers include JBoss AS, IBM WebSphere, and Oracle WebLogic.

### Differences between Application Server and Web Server

1. **Functionality:** As mentioned earlier, a web server serves static content, while an application server serves dynamic content generated by programs.

2. **Architecture:** A web server uses a single-threaded or multiple threads to handle requests. In contrast, application servers use a multi-tier architecture, including presentation, business, and database layers.

3. **Scalability:** Web servers are easy to scale horizontally by adding more servers to a cluster because they handle only static content. On the other hand, application servers are more complex to scale because they handle dynamic content and require a more substantial infrastructure.

## Requirements

To set up an infrastructure for web applications, we have the following requirements:

1. One server for a web server like Apache HTTP server, Nginx or Microsoft IIS.

We need a web server to serve static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images to the clients. It will handle the requests from the clients and return the web pages.

2. One server for an application server such as JBoss AS, IBM WebSphere, or Oracle WebLogic.

An application server is necessary to serve dynamic content, which includes business logic, authentication, and authorization. It will handle the services related to the application's logic and respond accordingly.

3. One server for a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle.

The database server will store the application's data, including user data, transaction history, and application configurations.

4. One load balancer like HAproxy configured as a cluster with the other one.

Load balancing is essential for managing traffic between servers. When we have more than one server, we need a load balancer like HAproxy, which can distribute the requests among servers to improve performance and availability.

## Conclusion

The application server and web server play a significant role in web application infrastructure. By separating the web server and application server, we can increase the flexibility, scalability, and performance of the infrastructure. The database server stores the application data and ensures the data consistency. Load balancing is essential for managing traffic between servers and improving performance and availability.
