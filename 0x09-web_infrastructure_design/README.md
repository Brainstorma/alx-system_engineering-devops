## General Objectives

The main objective of this repository is to provide a comprehensive guide to designing scalable and reliable web infrastructures. The content of this repository aims to give a clear understanding of the concepts and principles that are essential to building robust web infrastructures.

## Requirements

To run any of the files or scripts in this repository, you will need:

* A Unix-like operating system (macOS, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
* A shell terminal emulator
* Docker installed and running
* A basic understanding of networking, web servers, and databases

## Usage

This repository contains multiple directories, each with their own README.md file that provides an overview of the topics covered in the directory. Below you will find a list of each directory and a brief description of its content.

### [0-simple_web_stack](./0-simple_web_stack/README.md)

This directory contains an overview and basic architecture of a simple web stack. The web stack consists of a single server running a web application that serves static content. The directory also includes:

* A visual representation of the web stack architecture
* A list of tools and technologies used in the architecture
* Instructions for setting up the web stack using Docker

### [1-distributed_web_infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure/README.md)

This directory covers the architecture of a distributed web infrastructure. The architecture consists of multiple servers that are load-balanced and can handle increased traffic. The directory also includes:

* A visual representation of the distributed web infrastructure architecture
* A list of tools and technologies used in the architecture
* Instructions for setting up the infrastructure using Docker

### [2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure/README.md)

This directory covers the architecture of a secured and monitored web infrastructure. The architecture includes multiple servers, load balancers, firewalls, and monitoring tools. The directory also includes:

* A visual representation of the secured and monitored web infrastructure architecture
* A list of tools and technologies used in the architecture
* Instructions for setting up the infrastructure using Docker

### [3-scale_up](./3-scale_up/README.md)

This directory covers the different strategies and technologies that can be used to scale up a web infrastructure. The directory includes:

* A list of scaling strategies
* A brief overview of each scaling strategy
* An explanation of when and how to use each scaling strategy
