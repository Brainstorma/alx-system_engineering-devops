# One Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

## Introduction

This document outlines the infrastructure design for hosting the website www.foobar.com on a single server. The infrastructure includes a web server, application server, and a database. 

## User Access

When a user wants to access the website www.foobar.com, they type the domain name in a web browser. The request is then sent to the domain name system (DNS) to resolve the IP address of the server hosting the website. The DNS responds with the IP address configured for the www record, which points to the server IP address 8.8.8.8.

## Server

A server is a computer system that provides services or resources to other computers over a network. In this case, the server hosts the website that is accessible over the internet.

## Domain Name

A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control within the internet. It is used to identify one or more IP addresses with a name that is easier to remember and use in URL addresses. In this scenario, www.foobar.com is the domain name used to identify the website.

## DNS Record

The www record in www.foobar.com is a subdomain that is configured with a DNS record to point to the server's IP address. This record allows users to access the website using the domain name instead of the IP address.

## Web Server

A web server is software that responds to HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) and serves HTML pages and other content. In this infrastructure, Nginx is used as a web server to serve the website's static content.

## Application Server

An application server is software that runs application code and processes requests from clients. In this scenario, the application server is used to run the website's dynamic code and process user requests. 

## Database

A database is a software system used to store and manage data. In this infrastructure, MySQL is used as the database system to store and manage the website's data.

## Communication

When a user requests the website, their computer communicates with the server over the internet using HTTP. The request is then processed by the web server and application server before retrieving the necessary data from the database.

## Issues

There are several issues with this infrastructure, including a single point of failure, downtime during maintenance, and inability to scale if traffic exceeds server capacity. To address these issues, additional servers, load balancers, and other measures can be implemented. 

## Conclusion

This document provides an overview of a one server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com, including the roles of the various components and issues associated with the infrastructure. It serves as a starting point for further analysis and design of a more scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructure.
