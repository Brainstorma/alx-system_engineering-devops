# 0x13 Firewall üöí

This repository contains advanced scripts for configuring firewall rules on Linux systems. With the increasing threats of cyber attacks, it is highly recommended to have a reliable firewall mechanism in place to safeguard our systems and networks. The scripts provided in this repository are designed to block any incoming traffic except for the ones that are explicitly specified. 

## Task 0: Block all incoming traffic but‚öîÔ∏è

The first task in this repository is to configure the firewall to block all incoming traffic except for the ones that are specifically allowed. With this script, you can customize the rules to allow incoming traffic only from specified IP addresses, ports, and protocols. 

To view the code for this task, please follow this link: [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](./0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but).

## Task 100: Port forwarding‚è©

The second task in this repository is to configure port forwarding using firewall rules. This script helps to forward incoming traffic on a specific port to another internal or external IP address and port. This could be useful for setting up services and applications that require external access through a specific port on your network.

To view the code for this task, please follow this link: [100-port_forwarding](./100-port_forwarding).

Let's secure our systems and networks with these advanced firewall scripts!
