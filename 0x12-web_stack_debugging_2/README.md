## 0x12-web_stack_debugging_2

Welcome to the 0x12-web_stack_debugging_2 repository! Here, we tackle some of the most challenging and enigmatic web stack debugging issues with precision and efficiency.

### Tasks

#### Task 0: I am who I am

In this task, we explore the concept of users and permissions in the Linux environment. By switching users, we troubleshoot a web server that is returning a "forbidden" error.

#### Task 1: Run Nginx as Nginx

In this task, we ensure that the Nginx web server is running as the dedicated nginx user, rather than as root. We examine file permissions and configuration files to properly configure the web server.

#### Task 100: The Seven-Lines Fix

In this final task, we challenge ourselves to solve the issue at hand in just seven lines of code or fewer. We identify an issue with PHP-FPM configuration and use our precision troubleshooting skills to resolve the issue.
