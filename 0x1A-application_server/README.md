## Concepts

For this project, students are expected to look at these concepts:

* [Web Server](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/17)

## Background Context

While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project I added this piece to my infrastructure, plug it to my Nginx and make is serve my Airbnb clone project.
