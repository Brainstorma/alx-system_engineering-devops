# 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing

Welcome to the 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing repository! This repository contains programming exercises designed to teach you how to use loops, conditions, and parsing in a programming language of your choice.

## What is Loops_Conditions_and_Parsing?

Loops, conditions, and parsing are important constructs in programming languages. With these constructs, a programmer can control the flow of execution of the code, test conditions, and manipulate data. 

Loops are used to iterate a set of instructions or statements. This allows us to repeat a set of instructions until a given condition has been met. 

Conditions allow us to control the execution flow of a program. We can use if/else statements to make decisions based on input from a user or a given condition. 

Parsing is the process of taking a given data set, breaking it down into its component parts, and then translating it into a more usable format. Parsing allows us to manipulate and store data for later use.
