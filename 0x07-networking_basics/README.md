# 0x07. Networking basics #0
Welcome to the 0x07 Networking Basics #0 repository. In this repository, you will learn the fundamentals of computer networks. By the end of this repository you will have a comprehensive understanding of the layers in the OSI model, the TCP/IP model, the differences between them and the protocols used in each layer.

## What is Networking
Networking is the process of connecting two or more systems or devices for the purpose of sharing resources or exchanging data and information. Networks can range from small, home-based networks connecting computers in a home office to large, multi-site networks connecting terminals, mainframes and supercomputers.

Networks operate at several layers of abstraction. Each layer is responsible for certain functions such as ensuring reliable delivery of data, providing secure access to data, and providing access to applications and services.

## Layers of the OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model is a standard created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984. The OSI model is a seven-layer reference model used to describe how communication networks exchange data.

The layers of the OSI model are:

1. Application Layer
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Network Layer
6. Data Link Layer
7. Physical Layer

Each layer has its own set of protocols and services. The Application Layer is responsible for providing services directly to the user, while the Physical Layer is responsible for providing the physical connection between nodes on the network.

## Layers of TCP/IP Model
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is an open standard communications protocol suite created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1982. The TCP/IP model is a four-layer reference model used to describe how communication networks exchange data.

The layers of the TCP/IP model are:

1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Internet Layer
4. Network Access Layer

The Application Layer is responsible for providing services directly to the user, while the Network Access Layer is responsible for providing the physical connection and media access control.

## Differences between the OSI Model and the TCP/IP Model
There are several key differences between the OSI model and the TCP/IP model.

The most obvious is the number of layers - the OSI model has seven layers while the TCP/IP model has four. This difference is due to the fact that the OSI model is designed to be flexible and expandable while the TCP/IP model is designed with simplicity in mind.

Another key difference is the way in which the two models handle the Network and Data Link Layers. In the OSI model, these layers are separate, while in the TCP/IP model, the Network and Data Link Layers are merged into a single layer, known as the Internet Layer.

Finally, the protocols used by the two models are different. The OSI model uses a set of standard protocols, while the TCP/IP model uses a suite of protocols.
