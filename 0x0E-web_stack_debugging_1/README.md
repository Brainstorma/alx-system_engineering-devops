# 0x0E-web_stack_debugging_1

As a software engineer, it is important to be able to troubleshoot and debug issues, especially when it comes to web applications. In this project, we will delve into the world of web stack debugging, specifically for Nginx servers.

## Tasks

### [0-nginx_likes_port_80](./0-nginx_likes_port_80/)
For the first task of this project, we have been given a server with Nginx installed, but the server is not serving the expected content on port 80. We need to figure out what the issue is and fix it, so that the server properly serves the expected content on port 80.

### [1-debugging_made_short](./1-debugging_made_short/)
For the second task of this project, we have been given a broken script that needs to be fixed. The script is supposed to start Nginx, but it is failing due to an unknown issue. We need to figure out what the issue is and fix it, so that the script properly starts Nginx.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have a basic understanding of web servers, Nginx, Linux commands and some experience with debugging skills. 
This repository contains the following directories and files:

### [0-nginx_likes_port_80](./0-nginx_likes_port_80/)
This directory contains a Bash script that checks that Nginx is listening on port 80 of your server.

### [1-debugging_made_short](./1-debugging_made_short/)
This directory contains a Bash script that performs the same task as the script in the previous directory, but with fewer lines of code.

## Environment
This project is interpreted and run on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
